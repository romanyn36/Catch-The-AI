# About Dataset
This dataset consists of all 70k REAL faces from the Flickr dataset collected by Nvidia, as well as 70k fake faces sampled from the 1 Million FAKE faces (generated by StyleGAN) that was provided by Bojan.

In this dataset, all the images resized into 256px, data splited into train, validation and test set with following :.
- train:       100,000 images.
- validation:  20,000  images. 
- test :       20,000  images.  

we applied some Data Augmentation and rescaling.

# About Model 

We used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary classification to distungish between Real faces images and AI-generated faces images by other Ai models. 


Our model key features:
1. Input shape: Images of size 256x256 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB).
2. Model architecture: Sequential model: 
- - consisting 4 convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, ending with 2 fully connected layers.
3. Compilation: Adam optimizer is used with binary cross-entropy loss for binary classification.
4. Callback: ModelCheckpoint is set to save the best weights based on validation accuracy.

## evaluation 
we got accuracy about :
- 98% on training set.
- 95% on validation set.
- 96% on test set.
